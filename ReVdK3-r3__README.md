The script is optimized for Kali 2.0 and tested with a TP-LINK TL-WN722N wifi usb adapter.

The script launches reaver for a wps attack and detects if the router locks itself. 
If the router gets locked three additional interfaces are created for the usb adapter
(all with random MACs) and a flood attack is started on them to shock the router and
cause a reboot. If this is successful, the router reboots in its default configuration,
by this the wps attack can be continued until the router locks itself again. 
However, this will start again the flood attack...

If the router is not vulnerable to the flood attack you have to find a different technique.
